# Active Context

## Current Focus

- Setting up the core JARVIS virtual assistant framework
- Implementing the plugin architecture for extensibility
- Developing speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities
- Creating initial plugins for weather and music functionality
- Establishing the intent processing system
- Implementing error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Setting up logging for debugging and improvement

## Recent Changes

- Created main.py with the core JARVIS class and main execution loop
- Implemented IntentProcessor for handling user commands
- Developed the plugin system for dynamic loading of functionality
- Created the weather plugin with OpenWeatherMap API integration
- Implemented voice.py with speech recognition and text-to-speech functions
- Added logging throughout the application for debugging
- Set up configuration handling with environment variables
- Created basic error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Next Steps

- Implement more plugins (news, reminders, etc.)
- Enhance natural language processing capabilities
- Add context awareness to remember previous interactions
- Improve error handling and user feedback
- Create a more robust configuration system
- Implement unit tests for core components
- Add multilingual support beyond Spanish
- Develop a simple GUI interface (optional)
- Improve offline capabilities with Vosk

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- Whether to prioritize more plugins or improve core NLP capabilities
- How to handle context and maintain conversation state
- Whether to implement a database for persistent storage
- How to improve speech recognition accuracy in noisy environments
- Whether to add a simple GUI or keep it voice/CLI only
- How to handle authentication for user-specific features
- Whether to implement a more sophisticated ML model for intent recognition

## Important Patterns & Preferences

- Plugin-based architecture for extensibility
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Clear separation of concerns between components
- Consistent interface for all plugins
- Spanish language as the primary focus with English support planned
- Preference for offline capabilities where possible
- Emphasis on user feedback during errors
- Consistent voice and tone in responses

## Learnings & Project Insights

- Speech recognition works best with clear enunciation and minimal background noise
- Plugin architecture provides excellent extensibility but requires careful interface design
- Error handling is critical for voice interfaces where visual feedback is limited
- Regular expressions are effective for simple intent matching but have limitations
- Environment variables work well for configuration but a more robust system may be needed
- The combination of online (Google) and offline (Vosk) speech recognition provides good reliability
- Logging is essential for debugging voice interaction issues
- The system architecture needs to balance flexibility with simplicity
